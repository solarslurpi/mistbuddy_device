## VPD

Vapor Pressure Deficit (VPD) is a measure of the difference between the actual and saturation water vapor pressure at a certain temperature. It directly influences a plant's rate of transpiration.  High VPD results in increased transpiration, leading to potential plant stress from excessive water loss. This can manifest as wilted leaves, slowed growth, reduced crop yield, and in extreme cases, plants dry up and die.  High VPD conditions can deter certain pests preferring moist environments but can encourage others like spider mites and thrips that thrive in hot, dry conditions.  Low VPD can lead to reduced transpiration, affecting nutrient transport within the plant and causing lower rates of photosynthesis due to stomatal closure. This condition also increases the risk of diseases such as powdery mildew and botrytis, as well as other pathogens that thrive in high humidity.

Different plant types will prefer different ideal vpd levels.  Some plants, like cacti and other succulents, are adapted to arid environments with potentially high VPD levels. They have evolved various mechanisms to conserve water, such as reduced leaf surface area and the ability to store water in their tissues.  On the other hand, plants native to humid, tropical environments, like orchids, may prefer lower VPD levels. These plants have evolved to thrive in conditions of high humidity and are typically more sensitive to water loss through transpiration.

## Tasmota/Tasmotized

**Tasmota** is an open-source firmware developed for ESP8266 and ESP32 devices. These devices include things like smart plugs, light bulbs, and other Internet of Things (IoT) devices. It is designed to offer local control of your devices. The Tasmota GitHub provides [a list of Tasmota devices](https://templates.blakadder.com/).

The term **"Tasmotized"** is often used in the hobbyist community to refer to a device that has been flashed or reprogrammed with the Tasmota firmware. This is often done to extend the capabilities of the device or to make it compatible with a wider range of home automation software.

## Raspberry Pi

A Raspberry Pi is a small, affordable, credit-card sized computer that can be used for various projects and applications. It was developed by the Raspberry Pi Foundation to promote teaching of basic computer science in schools and developing countries. Key features include:

- Low cost
- Low power consumption
- Ability to run a full Linux operating system
- GPIO pins for interfacing with external hardware
- Supports various programming languages

In the context of MistBuddy, a Raspberry Pi is used to run the software that controls the humidifier by sending power on/off requests to the Tasmotized power plugs.

**CAVEAT: I have been using a build using these parts.  As in "it works for me."  I am not a professional.  I am sharing with in hopes it can benefit others.  I am not responsible for any damages to your home or property.
The humidifier is an evolution of the one in the YouTube video [How to Build a Homemade Humidifier Using Ultrasonic Misters / fogger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmiO6Z_HLCE).
